## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡So you may be asking yourself, why "Kakaoschluerfer", cause I like to drink a cold chocolate, as It's not as sweet like an ordinary hot chocolate.

###  THE RECIPE FETCHER ðŸŒ±
As I sometimes like to cook and bake, I always keep an eye open for great recipes.<br>
As I Would like to have a platform, where I could collect them.

And how would that work? No, not typing in every letter and word yourself,<br>
simply enter the url to the recipe and a recipe page will be created for it.

So far, that's my vision, the idea.
