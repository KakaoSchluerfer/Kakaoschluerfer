## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So you may be asking yourself, why "Kakaoschluerfer", cause I like to drink a cold chocolate, as It's not as sweet like an ordinary hot chocolate.

## Current Project / Ideas

As I sometimes like to cook and bake, I'm always looking for great recipes. 
As I Would like to have a platform, where I could collect them.

And how would that work? No, not typing in every letter and word yourself, 
simply enter the url to the recipe and a recipe page will be created for it.

So far, that's my vision, the idea.
